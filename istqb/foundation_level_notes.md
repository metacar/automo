### Root cause vs effect of a defect:

### Explain the terms:s

#### Error
#### Defect
its caused by an error made by a human being.
A defect in software or documents may result in failures, but not all defects do so.
#### Fault

#### Failure
Can be caused by environmental factors as well as caused by humans.
#### Mistake
#### Bug


### Differentiate testing and debugging

Debugging is the development activity that finds, analyzes and removes the cause of the failure.

### Explain the seven principles in testing

1. Testing shows the presence of defects
2. Exhaustive testing is imposible (except for trivial cases)
3. Early testing
4. Defect clustering

5. Pesticide paradox:
if the same set of test are ran, eventtually this test will not be reliable any longer.
They wont reveal new/different issues.
6. Testing is context dependent:

7. Absence of errors fallacy:


### Mention the five fundamental test activities and its respective tasks from planning to closure

### What are the psychological factors that influence the success of testing
### What are the differences in the developer and tester midset?
